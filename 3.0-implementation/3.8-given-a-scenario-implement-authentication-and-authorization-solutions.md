# 3.8 Given a scenario implement authentication and authorization solutions

## Authentication management

Authentication management **involves the implementation of various techniques and tools to authenticate users' identity and ensure that they are authorized to access specific resources or perform certain actions**. Some of the topics related to authentication management are:

- **Password keys**: A password key is a randomly generated code that is used to create a password. It is typically used to improve password strength and security. Password keys are often used in conjunction with a password manager to securely store and manage passwords.
- **Password vaults**: A password vault is a secure repository that is used to store passwords, credentials, and other sensitive information. Password vaults provide a centralized location for storing and managing passwords, which can help to reduce the risk of password theft or compromise.
- **TPM**: A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) is a hardware-based security device that is used to secure cryptographic keys and other sensitive information. TPMs are often used to provide secure boot functionality, which helps to prevent malware and other unauthorized software from running on a device.
- **HSM**: A Hardware Security Module (HSM) is a specialized device that is used to secure cryptographic keys and other sensitive information. HSMs are often used in high-security environments to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Knowledge-based authentication**: Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is a form of authentication that relies on the user's knowledge of specific information, such as a password, PIN, or security question. KBA is often used as a secondary form of authentication, in addition to something the user has or is (such as a token or biometric).

## Authentication/authorization

Authentication and authorization are two crucial processes in information security.

**Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, device, or system**. It is used to ensure that the user or system attempting to access a resource is indeed who they claim to be.

**Authorization**, on the other hand, **is the process of granting or denying access to a resource based on the authenticated identity of the user or system**.

Here are some common authentication and authorization protocols and technologies:

- **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)**: A protocol used in wireless networks to support various authentication methods.
- **Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**: A protocol used for authenticating remote users and devices, where the user or device must provide a secret password or key.
- **Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)**: A simple protocol used for authentication, where the user's password is transmitted in clear text.
- **802.1X**: A standard used for port-based network access control, which provides a framework for authentication and authorization.
- **RADIUS** (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service): A protocol used for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting for network access.
- **Single sign-on (SSO)**: A method of authentication that allows a user to log in once and access multiple applications or systems without the need to re-enter credentials.
- **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**: An XML-based protocol used for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.
- **Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)**: A protocol used for remote authentication and authorization in networked computing environments.
- **OAuth**: An authorization protocol that allows third-party applications to access a user's resources on a server without sharing the user's credentials.
- **OpenID**: A decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to authenticate with a single identity across multiple websites.
- **Kerberos**: A network authentication protocol that provides strong authentication for client/server applications using secret-key cryptography.

## Access control schemes

Access control schemes **are the methods used to regulate and manage access to information or resources in a system or organization**. These schemes involve the use of various techniques and mechanisms to ensure that only authorized entities are granted access to the system or information. Here are some commonly used access control schemes:

- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC)**: ABAC is an access control scheme that uses attributes or characteristics to define access policies and permissions. This scheme uses various factors like user attributes, environmental attributes, and resource attributes to determine whether access should be granted or denied.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: RBAC is an access control scheme that grants access based on a person's role within an organization. This scheme simplifies access management by defining permissions and roles for each user based on their job title or function within the organization.
- **Rule-based access control**: Rule-based access control is an access control scheme that allows access based on a set of rules. These rules define the conditions that must be met for access to be granted.
- **Mandatory access control (MAC)**: MAC is an access control scheme that grants access based on security labels. This scheme is typically used in highly secure environments where data and resources need to be highly protected.
- **Discretionary access control (DAC)**: DAC is an access control scheme where access is granted based on the discretion of the owner of the resource. This scheme allows the owner to determine who can access their resources and what level of access they are granted.
- **Conditional access**: Conditional access is an access control scheme that grants access based on certain conditions, such as the user's location, device, or time of day.
- **Privileged access management (PAM)**: PAM is an access control scheme that is used to manage and control access to critical systems and resources. This scheme ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information and resources.
- **Filesystem permissions**: Filesystem permissions are access control settings that are applied to files and directories on a file system. These settings determine who can access the file or directory and what level of access they have.
